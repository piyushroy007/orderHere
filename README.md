## orderHere - Your Food Ordering Experience

    "orderHere" is a comprehensive React application designed to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end development by creating a user interface that mirrors the functionality and user experience of popular food delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy. Leveraging the Swiggy API, "orderHere" allows users to seamlessly browse restaurants, explore detailed menus, and build a virtual cart for placing orders.

    This project goes beyond a simple API integration. It showcases my ability to architect a full-fledged, multi-page application, complete with a dynamic home page, detailed restaurant menus, a user-friendly cart, and informative "Contact Us" and "About Us" sections.
